Fake trash books spawn to make the achievement even harder to get, but keep at it. Make sure you click the fake trash books anyway, so the real books have a chance to spawn.
This is an achievement that _you may want to dedicate a lot of time to_ if you want it
|tip You'll have a much greater chance of earning the achievement if you camp each book until you have them all, rather than constantly running through the path in this guide
