description="Westfall borders the Kingdom of Stormwind and is mostly populated by humans not under the Alliance's complete control. The region was stolen right under the Alliance's nose by its own bitter people. Once a rich agricultural center, this land has lain fallow and forgotten since the Second War, but was held by the Defias Brotherhood for a time before the Cataclysm. Stormwind claimed the land as its own, but found little time to be concerned with it, with insufficient funds and might to retake the region. A handful of farmers still tried to keep their land, and some even attempted a tithe to Stormwind every year, but most only grew enough to feed themselves. Bandits and gnolls raided those farms that remained, and Stormwind's resources were stretched too thin to protect the beleaguered populace. The Defias Brotherhood controlled much of the region, focused in the southern area of Moonbrook.",
