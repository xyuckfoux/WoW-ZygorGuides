To earn this achievement, you will have to kill Warlord Parjesh _WITHOUT_ killing any Hatecoil Shellbreakers (Melee) enemies during the fight
You are able to use stuns on them to control them, notably _Monks Paralysis_ is very effective at controlling them
If you lack the crowd control, simply have the tank pick up the enemy, and use _single target abilities only_ to burn the boss down quickly
