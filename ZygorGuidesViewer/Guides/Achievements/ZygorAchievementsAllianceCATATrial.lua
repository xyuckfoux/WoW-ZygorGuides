Warning: These books have respawn timers of about 3-4 hours (it seems to be random between those times) so this achievement may take you a while to get
|tip The book you want won't always be there. Fake trash books spawn to make the achievement even harder to get, but keep at it. Make sure you click the fake trash books anyway, so the real books have a chance to spawn.
This is an achievement that you may want to dedicate a lot of time to if you want it
|tip You'll have a much greater chance of earning the achievement if you camp each book until you have them all, rather than constantly running through the path in this guide
Good luck!
